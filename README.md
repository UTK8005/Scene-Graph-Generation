# Concept-Graph-Generation
This project consists of the following:
1. Three object detection model(SSD/Retinanet/YoloV3)
2. Three third party image Captioning Models(BLIP/ViT-GPT2/GIT)
4. A graph generation algorithm(Using Stanza Dependency Parser)
5. A graph merging algorithm
6. A pipeline demonstrating scene graph generation.
The captioning models have been finetuned over Visual Genome Dataset.
